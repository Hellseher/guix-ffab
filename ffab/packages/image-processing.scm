    (description
     "IIPImage is an advanced high-performance feature-rich image server system
 for web-based streamed viewing and zooming of ultra high-resolution images.  It
 is designed to be fast and bandwidth-efficient with low processor and memory
 requirements.  The system can comfortably handle gigapixel size images as well
 as advanced image features such as 8, 16 and 32 bits per channel, CIELAB
 colorimetric images and scientific imagery such as multispectral images, image
 sequences and 3D surface topologies.
Features:
@itemize
@item fast lightweight FastCGI server
@item high performance with inbuilt configurable cache
@item support for extremely large images: tera-pixel and multi gigapixel support
@item TIFF and JPEG2000 input support
@item JPEG, PNG and WebP output support: export of whole or regions of images at
any size
@item supports IIP, Zoomify, DeepZoom and IIIF API's
@item 1, 8, 16 and 32 bit image support including 32 bit floating point support
@item CIELAB support with automatic CIELAB->sRGB color space conversion
@item multispectral and hyperspectral image support
@item image stacks and image sequence support
@item dynamic hillshading of 3D surface topologies
@item dynamic watermarking
@item memcached support
