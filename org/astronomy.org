GDL - GNU Data Language GDL is a free/libre/open source incremental compiler compatible with IDL
(Interactive Data Language) and to some extent with PV-WAVE. Together with its library routines it
serves as a tool for data analysis and visualization in such disciplines as astronomy, geosciences
and medical imaging. GDL development had been started by Marc Schellens back in early noughties and
has since continued with help of a team of maintainers, developers, packagers and thanks to feedback
from users.

  software clients and hardware devices. Since it is network transparent, it enables you to
  communicate with your equipment transparently over any network without requiring any 3rd party
  software. It is simple enough to control a single backyard telescope, and powerful enough to
  control state of the art observatories across multiple locations
