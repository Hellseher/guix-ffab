+astrophysical sources.
+
+X-rays probe the high-energy universe, from hot galaxy clusters to compact
+objects such as neutron stars and black holes and many interesting sources in
+between.  pyXSIM makes it possible to generate synthetic X-ray observations of
+these sources from a wide variety of models, whether from grid-based
+simulation codes such as FLASH, Enzo, and Athena, to particle-based codes such
+as Gadget and AREPO, and even from datasets that have been created “by
+hand”,such as from NumPy arrays.  pyXSIM also provides facilities for
+manipulating the synthetic observations it produces in various ways, as well
+as ways to export the simulated X-ray events to other software packages to
+simulate the end products of specific X-ray observatories.")
